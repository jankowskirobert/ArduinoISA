Fast SH1106 library for Arduino Due
==================================

A port of Arthur Liberman's fast SH1106 library to the Arduino Due.

This library supports low-cost 128x64 OLED displays using SPI with the SH1106 controller chip. User can also ommit using additional pin for RESET input. It can be simply connected to Arduino's RESET pin.

The original Arduino library can be found at http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=242880.0
